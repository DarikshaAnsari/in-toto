# Security Issues and Bugs

Security issues can be reported to maintainers [privately via
GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):

- [**Report new
  vulnerability**](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/security/advisories/new)

Please do not use the GitHub issue tracker to submit vulnerability reports. The issue
tracker is intended for bug reports and to make feature requests. Major feature
requests, such as design changes to the specification, should be proposed via [in-toto
Enhancement](https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/blob/master/ITE/1/README.adoc) (ITE).
